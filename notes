Channels is all about signalling

Attributes of channels
- guarantee of delivery
- state
- with or without data

Guarantee of delivery:
    - when we are wringing code we have to thin about do I need to guarantee
    its delivery before proceeding.
    - if yes then use unbuffered channels that block
    - if no use buffered channels

State:

channels have 3 states:
    - open
    - closed
    - nil


            |   NIL   | open    | closed
 --------------------------------------
 send       |blocked  | allowed | panic
 -------------------------------------
 receive    |blocked  | allowed | allowed
